Dive into the captivating world of the "Song of Storms" project, a musical odyssey that reimagines a beloved tune from the "Legend of Zelda" video game series. A spirited group of aficionados uniquely blended the soulful strains of human performers with the futuristic vibes of AI-enhanced vocaloids and the rhythm of machinery. Venturing beyond the boundaries of traditional Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) production, this ensemble employed the magic of AI vocaloids, the avant-garde Google Nsynth, and the versatility of the ChucK programming language.
